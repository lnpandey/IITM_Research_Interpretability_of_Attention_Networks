### Table 1: Complexity effect on 5D elliptical blob data
- Focus is functionally zero with no bias and 1 hidden layer initialised to xavier norm.
- Classify has 1 hidden layer with bias initialised to zero and weights initialised to xavier norm.
- Entry in the table is average over 10 runs and is of the form (avg Accuracy/ avg FTPT).
- Adam optimizer is used with LR = 0.001
- Zeroth layer averaging is used.

| Focus \\ Classify ->  | 50 | 100 | 200 |
|-------------------------|----|-----|------|
| 50  | 99.99/ 89.13 | 99.99/ 86.13 | 99.99/ 99.99|
